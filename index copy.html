For the past twenty-nine years, the ACM
Symposium on Applied Computing has been a
primary gathering forum for applied computer
scientists, computer engineers, software engineers,
and application developers from around the world.
<a href="http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2014/" target="_new">SAC 2014</a> is sponsored by the ACM Special
Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP),
and will be held in Gyeongju, Korea.

<div class="SectionContent">
Service-Oriented Programming (SOP) is quickly changing our vision of
the Web, bringing a paradigmatic shift in the methodologies followed
by programmers when designing and implementing distributed
systems. Originally, the Web was mainly seen as a means of presenting
information to a wide spectrum of people, but SOP is triggering a
radical transformation of the Web towards a computational fabric where
loosely coupled services interact publishing their interfaces inside
dedicated repositories, where they can be discovered by other services
and then invoked, abstracting from their actual
implementation. Research on SOP is giving strong impetus to the
development of new technologies and tools for creating and deploying
distributed software.  In the context of this modern paradigm we have
to cope with an old challenge, like in the early days of
Object-Oriented Programming when, until key features like
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and proper design
methodologies were defined, consistency in the programming model
definition was not achieved. The complex scenario of SOP needs to be
clarified on many aspects, both from the engineering and from the
foundational points of view.<br/><br/>

From the engineering point of view, there are open issues at many
levels. Among others, at the system design level, both traditional
approaches based on UML and approaches taking inspiration from
business process modelling, e.g. BPMN, are used. At the composition
level, although WS-BPEL is a de-facto industrial standard, other
approaches are appearing, and both the orchestration and choreography
views have their supporters. At the description and discovery level
there are two separate communities pushing respectively the semantic
approach (ontologies, OWL, ...) and the syntactic one (WSDL, ...). In
particular, the role of discovery engines and protocols is not
clear. In this respect we still lack adopted standards: UDDI looked to
be a good candidate, but it is no longer pushed by the main
corporations, and its wide adoption seems difficult. Furthermore, a
new implementation platform, the so-called REST services, is
emerging and competing with classic Web Services. Finally, features
like Quality of Service, security and dependability need to be taken
seriously into account, and this investigation should lead to standard
proposals.  <br/><br/>

From the foundational point of view, formalists have discussed widely
in the last years, and many attempts to use formal methods for
specification and verification in this setting have been made. Session
correlation, service types, contract theories and communication
patterns are only a few examples of the aspects that have been
investigated. Moreover, several formal models based upon automata,
Petri nets and algebraic approaches have been developed. However most
of these approaches concentrate only on a few features of
Service-Oriented Systems in isolation, and a comprehensive approach is
still far from being achieved.<br/><br/>

The Service-Oriented Architectures and Programming track aims at
bringing together researchers and practitioners having the common
objective of transforming SOP into a mature discipline with both solid
scientific foundations and mature software engineering development
methodologies supported by dedicated tools. In particular, we will
encourage works and discussions about what SOP still needs in order to
achieve its original goal.<br/><br/>

<p>
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers. Submission
of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed. Peer groups with
expertise in the track focus area will double-blindly review
submissions. Accepted papers will be published in the annual
conference proceedings. SOAP track chairs will not submit to the
track. Submissions from SOAP PC members and from PC members and track
chairs of other SAC tracks are welcome. Submission guidelines
can be found on the
<a href="http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2014/" target="_new">SAC 2014 website</a>.
Prospective papers should be submitted to the track using the provided
automated submission system. Please pay attention to ensure anonimity
of your submitted manuscript as detailed in the submission page so to
allow for double-blind review. Papers not satisfying this constraint
will be automatically rejected. The maximum length for papers is 8
pages. Accepted papers whose camera-ready version will exceed 6 pages
will have to pay an extra charge.  For each accepted paper, an author
or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement
for the paper to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library.
</p>
<p>
Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings.
An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library.
No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.</p>

<h2 class="SectionTitle">Student Research Competition Program</h2>
<div class="SectionContent">
Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (minimum of
2-page and maximum of 4-page) following the instructions published at
SAC 2014 website. Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks
is not allowed. All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by
researchers and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area
to which they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts will have
the opportunity to give poster presentations of their work and compete
for three top-winning places. The Student Research Competition
committee will evaluate and select First-, Second-, and Third- place
winners. The winners will receive cash awards and SIGAPP recognition
certificates during the conference banquet. Authors of selected
abstracts are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award
program for support.<br/><br/>
